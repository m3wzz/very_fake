        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is a methodological approach to optimizing interactions with large language models (LLMs) through carefully crafted input instructions. It encompasses techniques for designing, refining, and evaluating prompts to achieve desired outputs. This practice combines understanding of model capabilities, systematic testing methods, and iterative refinement processes. Key aspects include format specification, context provision, and task decomposition.\n",
